Instructions to add the Bearing Activity


1.	Once you have obtained a copy of the BearingActivity.java and activity_bearing.xml 
	place the .java file in the BRATA/src/com.harris.challenge.brata/tools folder and
	place the .xml file in the BRATA/res/layout folder.
   
2.	In the BrataLauncherActivity.java source file locate the following statement

	"List<ActivityItem> items = new ArrayList<ActivityItem>();"

	and insert below it the following line without single quotes.

	'items.add(new ActivityItem("Bearing Sensor",  R.drawable.ic_launcher, new Intent(this, BearingActivity.class)));'
	
3.	This should produce an error.  If so mouse over the error and select the 
	"import 'BearingActivity'" option and save.
	
4.	Finally make sure to add this activity to the AndroidManifest.xml.  Insert the 
	following line without quotes along with the declaration of the other activities.
	
	"<activity android:name=".tools.BearingActivity"></activity>"
	
5.	Once you save you should be able to run the BRATA application.
